Pinger:
-------
Pinger application is instance based - you can run several instances concurrently.
Each instance has its own configuration file and event db.

Each instance can be connected to multiple servers (guilds).
Most configuration options are guild based and stored inside configuration file by guild id:
 - access parameters
 - ping channels (for pings and scheduled event reminders)
 - offsets for reminders
Events are stored inside instance db on guild basis as well

Some options are strictly instance based:
 - bot auth token
 - tracker service url
 - tracker service auth token

If bot is used on several guilds and tracker service is enabled, it will use single tracker service for all guilds


Tracker:
--------
Tracker service is instance based as well.
To use tracker with Pinger you must generate a token for the instance, and set token and service url in Pinger instance parameters
Tracker url will be a base for urls that are PMed to users, so make sure your DNS resolution is set up.
Access to history is done through EVE SSO. To add users you must whitelist them.
